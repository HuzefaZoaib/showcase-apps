        <h2>Brief Professional Summary</h2>
        <span>
            With 15 years of experience, I specialize in problem-solving, software analysis, design, architecture, 
            and participation in the full software development lifecycle for web and enterprise applications. 
            I have collaborated closely with business leaders to analyze and generate solutions, transforming them 
            into software applications as per specifications. I have contributed in automating workflows and operational processes 
            through tailored solutions. My experience spans both waterfall and agile methodologies, and I possess strong 
            emotional intelligence (EQ), leadership, persuasive communication, and management skills.
        </span>
        <span>
            I began my career as a Java Full Stack Developer leveraging Servlets and JSPs, and have since gained expertise in various Java-related frameworks 
            such as Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Struts, ORMs, Microservices, JavaScript, Python, Angular, AWS, REST API Development, and more.
